      <h2> GIT FOR WEB DESIGN </h2>
      <p> The use of Git, and Github, in collaborative short-notice website redesign allows for a smoother, faster and less stressful development process. This is due to Git being a distributed version-control system, which constantly creates snapshots of code as it is created and altered throughout the design process - resulting in a timeline of changes created as they are made.

With Git, each designer within the developer team is allocated their own local repository, with a full history of commits. These individual repositories and histories hugely improve time efficiency, but most importantly reduce the risk of minor ‘muck ups’ affecting the entire project. If one designer were to accidentally delete part, or all, of their individual repository, this can be easily resolved by cloning another designer’s repository and starting anew. In this way, Git gives designers and developers the freedom to experiment and learn without the stress of potentially breaking the entire code.

Therefore, with Git’s advantages in regards to time efficiency, stress-free experimentation and ease of collaboration, it would be an incredibly useful tool for group short-notice website redesign.
